# ofxDocuApp

Simple application to document the process of a work by saving a photo in a recurring interval.
Use the spacebar to start/stop the recording. A new folder is created, every time a recording starts.
The pictures are saved in daily-based structure (data/rec/2013-08-08, data/rec/2013-08-08_1, ...).
