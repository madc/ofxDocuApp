# ofxDocuApp

Simple application to document the process of a work by saving a photo in a recurring interval.
Use the spacebar to start/pause the recording. The pictures are saved in daily-based structure (data/rec/2013-08-08, data/rec/2013-08-08_1, ...).
The 'r'-key allows to reset the recording and start with a new folder.
